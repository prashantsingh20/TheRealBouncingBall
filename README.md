# TheRealBouncingBall
A picture is worth a thousand words’ goes the ancient Chinese proverb. This has become a cliché in our society after the advent of inexpensive and simple techniques 
for producing pictures. Computers have become a powerful medium for the rapid and economical production of pictures. There is virtually no area in which graphical 
displays cannot be used to some advantage. Graphics provide a so natural means of communicating with a computer that they have become widespread. The fields in which
Computer Graphics find their uses are many. Some of them being User Interfaces, Computer Aided Design, Office automation, Desktop Publishing, plotting of mathematical, scientific, or industrial data, 
Simulation, Art, Presentations, Cartography, to name a few. Here, we have tried to incorporate and present the working environment of The Real Bouncing Ball.


Our project is an The Real Bouncing Ball made with OpenGL library in C++. In this animation there are multiple balls, the user can choose the number of balls and 
the size of the balls too. The balls demonstrate the concept of energy loss with each bounce and hence decrease in maximum height. User can choose the coefficient 
of restitution for each ball to understand the difference through audial visual of this project
